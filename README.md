## Purpose / Target Audience
The website is a demonstration of the skills that I have learned up until now. The purpose of the website is to demonstrate to myself, and any prospective employers that I have an understanding of how a basic website is built.
## Functionality / Features
The website is designed to the best of my knowledge to be semantic and responsive for mobile, tablet and laptop. The overall design was made to be simple with the idea being that the end user has easy access to all of the features available. Here is a brief overview of the individual pages;

1. **Index:** The index page displays basic personal information.
2. **About:** The about page displays more detailed personal information including; an introduction, past experience, and hobbies.
3. **Blogs:** The blogs page displays 5 Keanu Reeves related blogs with links to a separate page for each.
4. **Projects:** The projects page displays a list of project placeholders.
