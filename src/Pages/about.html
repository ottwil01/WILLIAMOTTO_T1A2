                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>My name is William Otto, and I am from Adelaide Australia. I have always had a passion for tech in its various forms, and decided that a web development bootcamp would be a great way to enter the industry. In addition to this, I am currently studying a bachelor's degree in mathematics, and I strongly believe the skills that I pick up from doing this course will help me with employment in various fields in mathematics.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h2>Previous Experience</h2>
                <p>Although my previous experience with programming is limited, I enjjoy being challenged, and I believe I am a fast learner with an insatiable appetite for the novel. Previous endeavours into programming include C++, R and Matlab.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h2>What I do for fun</h2>
                <p>My hobbies tend to change frequently, but things that I have managed to maintain over the years are, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, bouldering, guitar and piano. Aside from this, I like to exercise frequently, and get into nature.</p>
